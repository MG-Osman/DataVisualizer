## Future Improvements

This program is a simple demonstration of how to create custom data visualizations using matplotlib and tkinter. There are many ways to improve it and add more features. For example, you can:

- Add more options for the user to customize the chart elements, such as color, size, style, etc.
- Add more types of charts that matplotlib supports, such as boxplot, pie chart, heatmap, etc.
- Add validation and error handling for the user input, such as checking if the data is valid, if the file name is unique, etc.
- Add a file browser or a drag-and-drop feature for the user to select the file name and location to save the chart.
- Add a preview feature for the user to see the chart before saving it.
- Add a help or tutorial feature for the user to learn how to use the program and enter the data correctly.
